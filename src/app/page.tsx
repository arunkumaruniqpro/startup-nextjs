  title: "A SaaS based Zero Trust Network Access",
  description: "Zero trust, first coined by academia in the 1990s, is increasingly viewed as a mainstay of modern security strategies, taking over from traditional 'â€œcastle-and-moat"' network security models in which no one outside the network can access data on the inside, but everyone inside the network can. Commercial enterprises across the globe are fast moving toward zero trust, but public sector agencies are also being pushed to adopt zero trust cybersecurity principles and adjust their network architectures in a bid to  improve national cybersecurity.",
